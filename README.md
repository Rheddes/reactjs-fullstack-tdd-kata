# reactjs-fullstack-tdd-kata
TDD some features using React Hooks and GraphQL

## ðŸª› Setup
- Run `yarn` - install npm modules
- Run *tests*: `yarn test`
- Run *GraphQL Service*: `yarn start service`
- Run *front-end*: `yarn start` 
    - uses [webpack dev server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server), and should automatically fire up the browser for you!
    - you will _not_ see a build folder, it's in-memory.  If you really want to see a build folder show up, you can add `writeToDisk: true` under the `devServer` section
    
## Description
This Kata is set up initially to stretch your skills by working with React Hooks and GraphQL.

- If you prefer something other than GraphQL, well you forked it, do whatever you want!
- I will be adding more to this, check out the [TODOs](https://github.com/dschinkel/reactjs-fullstack-tdd-kata/projects/1)
- If you're ever stuck on this Kata, feel free to Join the [WeDoTDD.com Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/wedotdd/shared_invite/zt-ladr0ati-rD4bNNEx_Uu1v0pZsxZDNQ) and well give you some pointers on it!

## Tests

- Initial Libraries Used: [isolate-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/isolate-components), [mocha](https://mochajs.org), [chai](https://www.chaijs.com), and [supertest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest)
- [isolate-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/isolate-components): for those who insist on having mount/render scoped tests, it has the ability to create very focused [integrated tests](https://vimeo.com/80533536).  Instead of mounting the entire tree, you can render specific children in a React tree if desired which is really neat.

## Kata Features - ReactJS - Coffee Roasters
Implement the following full-stack features.  *If you don't like Coffee, tough luck!*

#### ðŸ–¥ Technical Requirements:
- Front-end should call the backend to get the data
- Implement it with Test Driven Development
- Hint: You can copy the feature names below, and literally use them as your very outside test names!

### ðŸ“œ End-to-End Slices
#### ~~Feature #1: Shows the text "Hello World"~~   *Done*
#### Feature #2: Shows a list of Coffee Roasters
#### Feature #3: Ability to reset/clear Roasters
#### Feature #4: Ability to Filter list by Roaster Name
#### Feature #5: Shows a *paged* list of Coffee Roasters
#### Feature #6: Ability to go to next page
#### Feature #7: Ability to go to previous page
#### Feature #8: Shows Roaster Detail Page
- ability to select a roaster somehow to see their detail page
- detail page should show a couple of roasts (e.g. Dark Roast, Light Roast)
