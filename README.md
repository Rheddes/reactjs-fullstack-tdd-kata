ReactJS Hooks with GraphQL kata

## Setup
- `yarn`
- Run tests: `yarn test`

## Description
This kata forces you to work with JS, React Hooks, GraphQL.

This kata shows an implementation, but please try to do it without looking at mine as much as possible.  This forces you to stretch your skills more if you have more pain with it up front.  That's part of your journey to learn TDD, React, etc.

Of course use whatever you want (React Classes, Koa, express, Hapi, whatever suites your fancy)
