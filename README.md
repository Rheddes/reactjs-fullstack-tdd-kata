# reactjs-fullstack-tdd-kata
## Description
This Kata is set up initially to stretch your skills by working with React Hooks, GraphQL, and Test Driven Development.

- If you prefer something other than GraphQL, well you forked it, do whatever you want!
- I will be adding more to this, check out the [TODOs](https://github.com/dschinkel/reactjs-fullstack-tdd-kata/projects/1)
- No, **TypeScript** is _not_ setup, this is a simple kata.  Add that setup yourself ðŸ˜Ž
- **_If you're ever stuck on this Kata_**, feel free to Join the [WeDoTDD.com Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/wedotdd/shared_invite/zt-ladr0ati-rD4bNNEx_Uu1v0pZsxZDNQ) and well give you some pointers on it!

## ðŸª› Setup
- Run `yarn` - install npm modules
- Run *tests*: `yarn test`
  
#### See it in action *(not required for tests)*
- Run *GraphQL Service*: `yarn start service`
- Run *front-end*: `yarn start` 
    - uses [webpack dev server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server), and should automatically fire up the browser for you!
    - you will _not_ see a build folder, it's in-memory.  If you really want to see a build folder show up, you can add `writeToDisk: true` under the `devServer` section
    
## Tests

- Initial Libraries Used: [isolate-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/isolate-components), [mocha](https://mochajs.org), [chai](https://www.chaijs.com), and [supertest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest)
- [isolate-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/isolate-components): for those who insist on having mount/render scoped tests, it has the ability to create very focused [integrated tests](https://vimeo.com/80533536).  Instead of mounting the entire tree, you can render specific children in a React tree if desired which is really neat
- Initial server spec for "Hello World" is directly testing the service contract.  No need to run the service.  _Going forward, you should also TDD with lower-level micro tests on core business behavior as the features evolve_
- You do not need to run the graphQL service or front-end in order to run tests.  Tests are headless and test the code directly without running the real thing

## Kata Features for "Coffee Roasters Website"
Implement the following full-stack features.  *If you don't like Coffee, tough luck!*

#### ðŸ–¥ Technical Requirements:
- Front-end should call the backend to get the data
- Implement it with Test Driven Development
- Hint: You can copy the feature names below, and literally use them as your very outside test names!

### ðŸ“œ End-to-End Slices
#### ~~Feature #1: Shows the text "Hello World"~~   *Done*
#### Feature #2: Shows a list of Coffee Roasters
